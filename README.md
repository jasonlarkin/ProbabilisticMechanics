# ProbabilisticMechanics

A mechanics derived from the assumption

Î´E[S]=0

S=hbar

This mechanics includes and generalizes both classical and quantum mechanics.  Mass, position, velocity, momentum, and energy can all be complex.  If all of these are real, the particle moves stochastically.  Other setups include quantum mechanics.  Classical mechanics is recovered in various limits.
